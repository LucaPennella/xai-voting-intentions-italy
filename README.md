## Abstract

Understanding voting intentions is a central challenge at the intersection of political science and machine learning.  
This study introduces an **explainable ML framework** that integrates demographic variables with **value-based attitudes** to identify the ideological drivers of Italian electoral behaviour.  

- Dataset: **4,500 survey responses** (2017â€“2019) from SWG & Rachael Monitoring  
- Methods: **Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM** with **Bayesian optimisation**  
- Explainability: **SHAP** values for feature attribution + **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** for model compactness  
- Key findings:
  - Values concerning **globalisation, immigration, and populism** improve predictive accuracy beyond demographics.  
  - Compact models (93 features vs. 188) retain predictive performance.  
  - Coalition-specific profiles emerge for **centre-right, centre-left, and M5S voters**.

## Reproducibility

### Requirements
- Python â‰¥ 3.9
- Main libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `lightgbm`, `xgboost`
  - `optuna`
  - `shap`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## ðŸ“Š Results

* **Best classifier**: LightGBM (macro-F1 = 0.669, Accuracy = 0.706 on 2019 hold-out)
* **Reduced feature set**: 93 predictors (performance comparable to full 188 features)
* **Key ideological dimensions**:

  * **Immigration & multiculturalism** (conservatives vs. progressives)
  * **European integration** (pro-EU left vs. Eurosceptic M5S)
  * **Populism** (threat acknowledged by left, denied by M5S)
